bikebus
=======

A web application demonstrating "multi-modal" trip planning for the city of New Orleans, allowing a user to get directions through the city using any combination of walking, bicycling, and public transit. It is specifically designed to address the need of bicyclists who might like to incorporate public transit into their daily travels. 

In order to provide access to the largest group of people, the webapp provides an interface through which a citizen can ask for directions via SMS text message. 

This code was written for the [Good Idea For New Orleans][good] project, with the aim of making "making bike transportation easier and safer". It leans heavily on open source software and open data.
